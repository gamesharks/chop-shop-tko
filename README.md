### Chop Shop TKO

  ## Description:
Our website is for MMA aficionados who want to compete with their friends to determine who the #1 fan truly is. Fans will be able to view fight schedules, fighter statistics, betting odds, and test their knowledge by wagering MMA bucks on who they think will win the main events. React was used for the front end to make a stylish and interactive web application, GraphQL was used with an Express.js and Node.js server, and MongoDB was used for the database.
